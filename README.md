## Introduction
Implemented vertical and horizontal image segmentation algorithim provided by Dr. Saquib Razak to detect Qatari license plate numbers from images. 

## Usage
decodeLicensePlate(filename) takes the filename of a license plate image as input. The function then loads the image represented by the filename and returns a string that represents the number on the license plate. Sample license plates can be found in the repo.
